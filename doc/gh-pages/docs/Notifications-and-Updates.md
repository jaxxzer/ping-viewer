To dismiss a single notification, click the ![](images/close.svg.png) icon on the notification. To dismiss all notifications, click the ![](images/clear.svg.png) icon at the bottom of the notification list.

## Application Updates

When the Ping Viewer application opens, it checks for application updates (requires an internet connection). If there is an update available, a notification will be displayed. To update the application, follow the [installation instructions](home#installing-and-running-the-application).

## Firmware Updates

After a device is connected, the Ping Viewer application checks if there is a newer firmware version available (requires an internet connection). If there is an update available, a notification will be displayed. To update the firmware, right click on the webpage and click 'save as'. Visit the [Firmware Update](firmware-update) menu and select the firmware file that you saved to update the device.
